# hard (home automation rust-daemon)
This is my very customized home automation project written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Over a time, more features and supported devices were added to this daemon.

Features:
- [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/) Time Series Database support for collecting misc stats
- Huawei SUN2000 inverter support

The daemon is running on my Raspberry Pi in a specific minimal ramdisk environment:<br>
